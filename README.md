# mapjfx

**NOTE:** branch 1.x based on Java 1.8 is not developed further.

mapjfx provides a JavaFX region containing a map, allowing to zoom, pan, and use markers.

It uses [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org) as the map technology.
More Information about the project can be found at [the sothawo website](http://www.sothawo.com/projects/mapjfx/).

## Java versions and branches

the original version started with JDK8. In November 2018 I started the branch _2.x_ which is set to use Java 11 as the
 main development branch.

Pull requests should be based on _1.x_ for changes/backports in the Java 8 version and to _2.x_ for the current version.

Releases are based on _master_ for the _2.x_ branch ad on _master-1.x_ for the _1.x_ branch.
 
## running the test application

the project contains a test application which is mostly used during development. The source is found in the test
sources (src/test/java). It is compiled and executed with the following command (no need to build the library first):

`mvn test exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.sothawo.mapjfx.TestApp" -Dexec.classpathScope=test`

The test application does not contain all the features, to have that, check
 [mapjfx-demo](http://www.sothawo.com/projects/mapjfx-demo/)
